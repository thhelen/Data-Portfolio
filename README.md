# Global Socio-Economic Analysis: Poverty, Corruption and Health

 Through this project we aim to shed light on two socio-economic issues i.e. poverty and corruption and
 its effect on healthcare and other socio-economic factors in the Human Development Index. The
 intuition is that a country that suffers from poverty has a tendency for corruption and similarly, where
 corruption is high, the region suffers from poor socio-economic conditions. We want to explore the
 same and see if we can analytically find the correlation for various developing and developed countries.
 Also, the effect of these two issues on the healthcare system of these countries needs to be explored.
 A few questions that we want to answer through the project are:
 1) What's the correlation between poverty and corruption?
 2) Dothese factors affect the healthcare system?
 3) What is the relation between poverty and different health statistics?
 4) Howdoes poverty affect different parts of the world?
 5) What do these factors look like in different regions of the world?

 The objective of this project is to also find the socio-economic factors that most strongly affect the
 health of society. We want to see if there are countries that are doing better in healthcare while
 suffering from these issues and find out that if we can conclude that with solving such systemic issues,
 there will be betterment in healthcare facilities of the country.

# Data Sources

 -  We are using the World Bank's Open Data on Poverty and Equity database as the primary dataset. This
 dataset includes statistics on poverty and inequality that have been collected from reputable
 international sources. Poverty indicators include the poverty ratio, the poverty gap, and the number of
 poor people at both international and national poverty lines. The Gini index and distributions of income
 or consumption are indicators of inequality. The database contains ratings for countries, regions, and
 the world. We are primarily interested in their estimations of the nation's Gini index, a commonly used
 indicator of economic inequality, because we are curious to understand how corruption, health factors,
 and financial inequality are related.
- Corruption Perceptions Index: The Corruption Perceptions Index evaluates and ranks countries/regions based on how corrupt the country's public sector is perceived to be. This index has been derived from a combination of surveys and assessments collected by several reputable institutions. CPI is the most widely used corruption index in the world.
- World Health Statistics: This dataset contains the latest and most up-to-date health statistics from around the world. From this dataset we will be looking at major attributes such as infant mortality rate, alcohol substance abuse, suicide rate, life expextancy at birth rate, and population percentage that spends more than 25% of expenditure on healthcare.
